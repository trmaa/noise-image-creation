this just creates random images and thecides which pixels are more compatible with one image through several iterations until you are happy with the result. I just wanned to practice shaders... :)

![](bin/result_img/0-1.ppm) 1 iteration
![](bin/result_img/0-10.ppm) 10 iterations
![](bin/result_img/0-100.ppm) 100 iterations
